| simultaneous read from different addresses | simultaneous_read_different_address | Goal: test ability of memory to handle reads from both ports simultaneously<br>read address from  port A<br>read different address from port B at same cycle<br>verify the read data is consistent and have not changed |<ul><li>- [ ] </li></ul> |
| simultaneous write to differnt addreses | simultaneous_write_different_address | Goal: test ability of memory to handle writes from both ports simultaneously<br>write to random address from  port A<br>write to different address from port B at same cycle<br>read data written and verify that it's consistent |<ul><li>- [ ] </li></ul> |
| simultaneous write to the same address | simultaneous_write_same_address | Goal: check the behaviour of memory with collisions<br>write to address , random data on  port A<br>write to same address , random data , on port B at same cycle<br>Read same address verify arbitration logic |<ul><li>- [ ] </li></ul> |
| simultaneous write and read to the same address | simultaneous_write_read_same_address | Goal: ensure consistency accessing data with different modes of operation<br>write random data to an address on  port A<br>read same address at the same cycle on port B<br>ensure that the new value has been read |<ul><li>- [ ] </li></ul> |
| out of range memory access | out_of_range_memory_access | Goal: check for out of range access handling<br>write on illegal address<br>read from the same illegal address<br>check if illegal range was handeled accordingly (designer didn't specify how it works it yet) |<ul><li>- [ ] </li></ul> |
| reset test | reset_test | Goal: write random data and random address<br>apply reset<br>read same address<br>should read default 0 value from memory |<ul><li>- [ ] </li></ul> |
| back to back writes on  port A | B2B_writes_porta | Goal: test handling of continous writing on memory from  port A<br>write random data with random address from port B continously<br>verify correct data and arbitration |<ul><li>- [x] </li></ul> |
